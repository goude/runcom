# Linux Virtual Environment Notes

## VirtualBox

- Need to enable virtualization in BIOS (one symptom if you don't: unable to create 64-bit virtual machines). See https://www.howtogeek.com/213795/how-to-enable-intel-vt-x-in-your-computers-bios-or-uefi-firmware/

- If you are behind a proxy, you may need to run `VBoxManage modifyvm "VM name" --natdnshostresolver1 on` to get DNS working properly. See https://superuser.com/questions/641933/how-to-get-virtualbox-vms-to-use-hosts-dns

## Corporate Proxies

## Docker

## Vagrant
